
Type	Meaning
book	    A single book object
book*     	A pointer to a book object
book* b[5]  An array of 5 pointers to book objects
book**	    A pointer to an array of book pointers


Returning b requires book** getbook(), not book* getbook() because b is not a single pointer but a pointer to multiple book pointers.
